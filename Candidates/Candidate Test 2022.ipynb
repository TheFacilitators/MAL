    "# Candidate Test 2022 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise focuses on the candidate tests from two television networks: DR and TV2. Data from both tests have been given on a scale of five responses (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2). Consider normalizing the data or performing similar scaling transformations as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 datasets included in this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `alldata.xlsx`: Contains responses from both TV stations.\n",
    "- `drdata.xlsx`: Contains responses from DR.\n",
    "- `drq.xlsx`: Contains questions from DR.\n",
    "- `tv2data.xlsx`: Contains responses from TV2.\n",
    "- `tv2q.xlsx`: Contains questions from TV2.\n",
    "- `electeddata.xlsx`: Contains responses from both TV stations for candidates who were elected to the parliament. Note that 9 members are missing; 7 of them didn't take any of the tests. Additionally, some notable figures like Mette F. and Lars Løkke did not participate in any of the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "It's entirely up to you how you approach this data, but at a *minimum*, your analysis should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PCA or some other dimensionality reduction technique to plot responses in two dimensions, thereby visualizing the \"political landscape\". The colors of the plotted points should match the political party colors (see below).\n",
    "- An analysis/description of which questions are most crucial concerning their placement on the axes.\n",
    "- Average positions of parties concerning each question, preferably with accompanying plots of each (or selected) question.\n",
    "- Age of the candidates grouped by parties.\n",
    "- An overview of the most \"confident\" candidates, i.e., those with the highest proportion of \"strongly agree\" or \"strongly disagree\" responses.\n",
    "- Differences in responses between candidates, both inter-party and intra-party, along with an explanation of which parties have the most internal disagreements.\n",
    "- Classification models to predict candidates' party affiliations. Investigate if there are any candidates who seem to be in the \"wrong\" party based on their political landscape positions. You must use the following three algorithms: **Decision Tree, Random Forrest, and Gradient Boosted Tree**.\n",
    "- A clustering analysis where you attempt various cluster numbers, which would correspond to different parties. Discuss whether there is room for more clusters/parties or if a reduction is needed. Make sure you cover: **K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.**\n",
    "- An overview of the political landscape of the elected candidates, highlighting which members agree or disagree the most and which parties or party members have significant disagreements.\n",
    "- Feel free to explore further and remember that preprocessing, methodology, and evaluation metrics are not mentioned explicitly, but are implicitly assumed.\n",
